<p class="mainHead">Description:</p>
<p class="pgh-text">The Basically Useless Gearbox, or B.U.G. for short, is a robot that can dance, wander around aimlessly whilst avoiding obstacles, take pictures, play music, or follow your every command via an iPhone app.</p>
<p class="mainHead">Inspiration:</p>
<p class="pgh-text">	Long long ago (summer of 2015), I was on the 3rd floor of an electronics mall in Taipei, Taiwan when I walk into a somewhat sketchy looking shop. To my delight, they were selling a whole bunch of cool stuff (Arduinos, Raspberry Pis, robots, etc.). After looking around a bit my eyes settled upon a plastic chassis (I had attempted hacking a really old motorized toy I had with my Arduino before with limited success). I bought the chassis with the intent of getting my Arduino to control it someday.</p>
<p class="pgh-text">	Toward the end of summer of 2016 (about a year later), I was bored and decided to build a very small box like robot using the chassis that I had bought. Instead of using the full chassis, I decided just to glue the gearbox motors together with a piece a cardboard resulting in a much smaller size.</p>
<p class="pgh-text">	I would often bring this contraption to school with me and a friend started calling it my little bug. Hence, as a joke, I named it B.U.G., the Basically Useless Gearbox.</p>
<p class="mainHead">Development & Challenges:</p>
<p class="pgh-text">One of the main challenges with B.U.G. is its size. I can only attach so many things to it before it becomes impractical. This made powering BUG a challenge. At first I used 4 triple As and tried a few different placements and battery packs, after a time it became clear 4 triple As and their 1000 mah capacity would give my 500ma power hungry robot very little battery life. I eventually switched to 4 double A batteries instead, and I plan to eventually switch to rechargeable lithium-ion batteries.</p>
<p class="mainHead">Shortcomings:</p>
<p class="pgh-text">Not too many shortcomings in terms of living up to its name I&rsquo;m afraid. However, if I were to choose something, I think that B.U.G.&rsquo;s size is both a redeeming and restricting feature. It limits what I can add on to it while also challenging me to see what I can do on such a small platform.</p>
