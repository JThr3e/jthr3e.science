<p class="mainHead">Start Date:</p>
<p class="pgh-text">October 2015</p>
<p class="mainHead">Completion Date:</p>
<p class="pgh-text">January 2016</p>
<p class="mainHead">Languages & Technologies Used: </p>
<p class="pgh-text">Swift, iOS</p>
<p class="mainHead">Description:</p>
<p class="pgh-text">Extirswipe is a speed based matching game where you have a limited amount of time to match objects of certain categories (shapes, colors, or numbers).</p>
<p class="mainHead">Inspiration:</p>
<p class="pgh-text">I was simply messing around with Xcode to see what I could do with it. One thing led to another, and a few months later, I had a game. (And learned how to code in Swift along the way).</p>
<p class="mainHead">Development & Challenges:</p>
<p class="pgh-text">Developing Extirswipe was particularly challenging because Swift was the first Language I had taken upon myself to learn that had significantly different syntax than Java. Instead of taking an online course in Swift or going through a tutorial, I decided to tackle the learning head on by programming what I could and researching whatever I didn’t know the syntax for. I feel like this was a much more rewarding experience than if I had just taken an online Swift course instead.</p>
<p class="mainHead">Shortcomings:</p>
<p class="pgh-text">As an app, this had many shortcomings. First of all, since I was using this as more of a way to teach myself a new programming language rather than an actual app, I wasn’t following any particular design plan. This lead to an array of problems such as the game being too difficult to intuitively understand how to play, and for the game itself to lack elements that would make it interesting enough for a user to keep coming back to play more.</p>
