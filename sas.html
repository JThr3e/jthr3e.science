<p class="mainHead">Description:</p>
<p class="pgh-text">&ldquo;Seat a Student&rdquo;, uses student preferences and classroom layout to generate a seating chart.</p>
<p class="mainHead">Inspiration:</p>
<p class="pgh-text">	One day I watched my high school computer science teacher as she slogged through completing seating charts for each of her 5 classes. She would always pass around half sheets asking students about their seating preferences (who they did/didn&rsquo;t want to sit next to, preference to sit closer to windows or front of the room, etc.). It seemed like such a repetitive and arduous task and it made me wonder if there was a way to get a computer to do it…</p>
<p class="pgh-text">	 The idea had slipped out of mind for a few months until I learned about a data structure called a graph. The graph instantly reminded me of the seat a student problem: each student could be a node while each listed preference for another student would be an edge connecting the two students! (I named it &ldquo;Seat a Student&rdquo; to parody the intro programming class’s assignment called &ldquo;Pick a Student&rdquo;) I got to work coding and white boarding, and I soon realized that although I had a powerful way of modeling the problem. I had yet to find a decent way to solve it. Once again the project faded back into the depths of my mind.</p>
<p class="pgh-text">	That summer I participated in an internship at a startup company called &ldquo;The Wireless Registry&rdquo;, and they wanted me to look into methods to optimize their mobile API. One day while looking for machine learning algorithms and libraries I could implement, I came across evolutionary algorithms. I realized this was the last piece of the seat a student problem! I came up with a way to represent possible seating arrangements in chromosomal form and ran these in the algorithm to optimize the seating charts.</p>
<p class="mainHead">Development & Challenges:</p>
<p class="pgh-text">Several times during this project, I ran into road blocks that hindered me from proceeding simply because I didn&rsquo;t know enough about what I was doing to know where to even look for solutions. I overcame this just by keeping the idea/project in the back of my mind and trying to learn as much as I could. I have begun to realize that sometimes I have to give myself some time so my knowledge has time to catch up with my ideas.</p>
<p class="mainHead">Shortcomings:</p>
<p class="pgh-text">The UI/UX. The whole program was text based and I never really got around to building a GUI and that made it pretty difficult to use.</p>
