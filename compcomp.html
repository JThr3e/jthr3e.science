<p class="mainHead">Start Date:</p>
<p class="pgh-text">April 2017</p>
<p class="mainHead">Completion Date:</p>
<p class="pgh-text">May 2017</p>
<p class="mainHead">Languages & Technologies Used: </p>
<p class="pgh-text">Paint, Paint.net, Windows Live Movie Maker, YouTube, Python (yes, I actually did use Python)</p>
<p class="mainHead">Description:</p>
<p class="pgh-text">Computational Complexity in a Nutshell is a video that gives a brief (and somewhat humorous) overview of computational complexity and related topics (P vs NP, ML & AI, Big O, etc).</p>
<p class="mainHead">Inspiration:</p>
<p class="pgh-text">Our final project for Math (senior year of high school) was to make/give a presentation on a Math topic unrelated to calculus. This seemed kind of boring to me&hellip; so I settled on attempting to make a humorous video explaining computational complexity instead! (Although this is technically a school project, I went far beyond what was required. I think this video earns a spot on my side projects website given the amount of time and effort that went into making it!)</p>
<p class="mainHead">Development & Challenges:</p>
<p class="pgh-text">Halfway through drawing up the frames for my video I realized I was using the wrong aspect ratio!! However, instead of going back and editing 50 or so frames by hand, I decided to write a Python script to fix each of the images for me. </p>
<p class="mainHead">Shortcomings:</p>
<p class="pgh-text">Of course, my drawings in the video were quite awful, and sometimes the timing of certain parts were a little off.</p>
